# RAMP models
This folder contains models specific to RAMP, with the exception of the RAMP intake models in the app/models/intake folder.

RAMP was developed as a pilot to AMA, where a veteran could choose to close all of their eligible legacy appeals and opt them into AMA in a batch (all or nothing).
